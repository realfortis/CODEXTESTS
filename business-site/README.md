# Business Site Template

This is a basic website template built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). It includes example pages for a home page and an about page.

## Getting Started

To run the site locally, install dependencies and start the dev server:

npm install
npm run dev
```

## Building for Production

```

The output will be in the `dist` folder.
